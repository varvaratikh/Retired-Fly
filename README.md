# Retired-Fly

### In progress...

Welcome to **Retired-Fly**, an online store I created for grandparents who refuse to be defined by their age. This platform is dedicated to vibrant seniors who choose to live life to the fullest and embrace their unique style. I designed this project to inspire a fresh perspective on retirement, proving that age is just a number and fashion has no boundaries.
